# About
I normally don't play casual games, so I was pretty astonished when I found myself glued to my tractor farming fields of black goji berries for hours on end with my girlfriend. It was probably around the 20-hour mark that I realized that I was addicted to Farm Together! 

As the hours of plowing, sowing, watering, and harvesting ticked by, I had a feeling that I was most likely not optimizing for profit... and the more I played, the less satisfied I felt. So down the developer rabbit hole I went. 

What started as a simple spreadsheet with a few crops quickly grew into a big ugly mess that I hated staring at. I figured, why not make something not ugly that would be available to all Farm Together players? And thus, FarmTogetherDB was born! I hope to help Farm Together players learn more about the game by creating useful calculators, tools, and guides.

If you want to support the site, get in touch, or check out what's planned for FarmTogetherDB, I've provided the info below!
